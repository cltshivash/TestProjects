## Collect Dumps (mini) to debug hangs in pipeline
- NOTE: The pipeline agent needs to running under admin privileges
- Step 1: Dump Collection Monitor Start
     - Add a powershell task before your test task (to start monitoring for dump collection)
     -  The task script contents would be inline.
        `$scripLocation='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cltshivash/TestProjects/master/TestHang/DumpCollect.ps1'`
        
        `iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString($scripLocation))`
       
   - Set the below environment variables in the task
   
      `TimeoutInMinutes <time to wait in minutes before attempting dump collection>`
      
      `ProcessNamesToTrack <comma separated processe names to collect dumps for.`
      
      `Recommended value : testhost*,dotnet*,vstest.console*`

    -  The task script contents would be inline.
    
       `$scripLocation='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cltshivash/TestProjects/master/TestHang/UploadDumpFiles.ps1'`
        
       `iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString($scripLocation))`
